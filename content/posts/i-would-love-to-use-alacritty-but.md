A few days ago I started working on my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/profe55orx/dotfiles). I was sold on the idea of
using that new kid in the block called
[alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty). A brand new and shiny [rust]
built terminal emulator which is woshiped by terminal hipsters lately.  A few
words before I get down to this. Alacritty is a nice piece of software and
this is not me naging about it. It mainly me sharing my experience.  So, TL;DR
if you are using a uk mapped macbook trying to figure why hash character is not
working properly and why it works perfectly in any other terminal emulator is
not worth the time. Tried to fix it, ended up in github issues, tried some
solutions, did not worked, gave up. And do not get me wrong. I wish I had the
time to investigate more but I do not. Again it is a good software probably too
niche for myself. I like simple plug and play stuff these days.
